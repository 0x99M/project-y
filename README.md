### web/
The marketing site built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and Framer Motion. Deployed on Railway.

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

### scripts/
- `release.sh` — reads version from `linux/package.json`, uploads `.deb` and `.AppImage` to GitHub Releases, and syncs version strings across the web app.

## Release

```bash
./scripts/release.sh
```

This uploads the binaries to GitHub Releases and updates all version references in `web/`.
