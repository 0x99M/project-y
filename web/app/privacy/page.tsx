      <h2>The Desktop App</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Clipmer operates entirely offline.</strong> The desktop
        application does not transmit any clipboard data, usage data, telemetry,
        or personal information to any server. Your clipboard history is stored
        locally on your device at <code>~/.config/clipmer/</code> and is never
        accessed by us.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app does not contain analytics, tracking pixels, or any form of
        remote data collection.
      </p>

      <h2>The Website</h2>
      <p>
        The Clipmer website (clipmer.app) does not use cookies or third-party
        analytics. We do not track your browsing behavior.
      </p>

      <h2>Purchases</h2>
      <p>
        When you purchase a Clipmer Pro license, the transaction is processed by{" "}
        <strong>Paddle</strong> (paddle.com), our payment provider. Paddle
        collects your payment information and email address as the Merchant of
        Record. We receive only your email address for the purpose of delivering
        your license key.
      </p>
      <p>We do not store credit card numbers or payment details.</p>

      <h2>Email</h2>
      <p>
        We send exactly one email when you purchase a license: your license key.
        If you request a key resend, we send one additional email. We do not
        send marketing emails, newsletters, or promotional content.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
      <p>
        To delete your local clipboard data, uninstall Clipmer or delete the{" "}
        <code>~/.config/clipmer/</code> directory. We don&apos;t store any
        customer data on our end — there&apos;s nothing for us to delete.
      </p>
